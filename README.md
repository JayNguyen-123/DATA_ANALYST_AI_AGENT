# DATA_ANALYST_AI_AGENT
Introduction AI Agent for data analysis: This AI automation can interpert your question using OpenAI function calling and generate accurate answers with charts.

The Architecture

- Loading and Inspection: Load data from various formats/sources and also present a first set of impressions about structure, data types, and basic statistics. Consider these as the AI’s getting-familiar phase with your data.

- Statistic Analysis: These functions offer mathematical interpretations of data from basic descriptive statistics to more complex correlation analyses. They are designed to yield results presented in formats appropriate for the AI interpretation and for the user component descriptions.

- Visualization: These functions will produce charts, graphs, and plots as the AI determines the analysis. It is very important that they be flexible enough to handle various data types and still produce outputs readable by humans.

- Filtering and Data Transformation: Through these, the AI can cut, dice, and reshape data according to the user query.
